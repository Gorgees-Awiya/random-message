# Random Message Generator

## Description
This project is a **random message generator** that selects a decade (60s, 70s, 80s, or 90s) and then picks a **music genre, clothing style, and dream car** from that decade. The selections are randomly generated based on predefined data.

## Features
- Randomly selects a decade from **1960s, 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s**.
- Picks a music genre, clothing style, and car from the same decade.
- Uses JavaScript objects and functions to generate the output dynamically.

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript (Node.js)

## How to Run the Project
1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your computer.
2. Clone the repository from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gorgees-Awiya/random-message.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
4. Run the script using Node.js:
   ```bash
   node script.js
   ```

## Example Output
```
You are from the 80s generation. Your favorite music is 'Synthpop', your favorite fashion is 'New Romantic Style', and your dream car is 'Ferrari Testarossa'.
```

## Future Improvements
- Add more decades (2000s, 2010s, etc.).
- Improve styling if converted into a web-based project.
- Add more categories like movies, trends, or famous people from each decade.
